/**
 * Which platform controls the host's own bar draws, per variant.
 *
 * A DECISION, exported so `embed-context.test.ts` can ask it without a DOM.
 *
 * - `page`: nothing - the emitted header draws every platform control.
 * - `app`: the standalone single-game bundle. No emitted header at all, so
 *   this bar is the ONLY platform chrome and draws back, the wallet and mute.
 * - `embed`: the same bundle inside a STRANGER's iframe. Back goes, because
 *   inside an iframe there is nowhere for it to go: the visitor did not
 *   navigate here, so back either does nothing or walks the host's own
 *   history, and the frame already carries one deliberate way out with
 *   `target="_top"`. The wallet goes because it is a PLAYER's - coins earned
 *   on ellaz.fun, drawn on somebody else's site for somebody who has not
 *   earned them. Mute stays: sound is the one control a framed visitor
 *   genuinely needs, and nothing on the host's page offers it.
 *
 *   Verified on the built bundle in a real iframe (2026-09-02): the frame
 *   renders 0 back buttons, 1 mute button and no wallet text.
 *
 * `app` is unchanged by the embed case, on purpose: the standalone bundles on
 * itch and Newgrounds draw exactly what they drew before.

          IT WAS ABSOLUTE, AND IT COVERED A CONTROL. Measured in a browser on
          the built bundle, 2026-09-03: anchored to `bottom: max(12px, ...)` of
          this container at zIndex 20, the pill landed on `memory`'s "Two
          players" button (chip 526-556, button 512-549) and, on the same
          reading of `maze`, across the direction pad's DOWN arrow (chip
          443-495, arrow 432-492). Every DirectionPad game puts its steering at
          the bottom centre of this box, which is exactly where a centred
          floating pill goes. Nothing in the suite could see it: a chip that
          covers a button renders, mounts, tests and type-checks perfectly.

          So the rule here is not "pick a safer offset" - it is that this chip
          does not get to occupy space a game is already using. In flow, the
          same overlap check returns zero covered controls.

              Operator report, filed as issue #22: "Show a win screen with
              restart and share so users have actions to do when game is
              finished." Photographed on the built artifact first
              (`scripts/repro/shoot-parking-win.mjs`): the largest thing on a
              won board was the game's own Step back button, DIMMED to 0.42
              because a finished board has nothing to take back, and the only
              way to play again was a 40px icon in the page header.

              It restarts through the SAME slot the header button uses
              (`@ui/gameTools`), never a second implementation - two ways to
              start a game drift, and the one nobody plays drifts first. */}

              // board that had already been replayed and sharing a result the
