/* The picture a player sends - PURE, a string in and a string out.
   ===========================================================================

   Sibling of `src/build/ogCard.ts`, and the differences are all consequences of
   ONE fact: that file runs in NODE at build time, this one runs in a BROWSER on
   a phone. Everything below follows from that, and the three traps `ogCard.ts`
   is shaped around behave DIFFERENTLY here rather than identically:

   1. BIDI - INVERTED, and this is the one that would have shipped wrong.
      `ogCard.ts` reorders Hebrew itself with `bidi-js`, because neither satori
      nor resvg implements UAX#9 and both lay `<text>` out in logical order. A
      BROWSER implements it: that is what a browser IS. So this file must NOT
      reorder - pre-reordering here would hand the browser a reversed string to
      reverse again, and "נחש" would rasterise as "שחנ" for exactly the reason
      the build path avoids. The fix there is the bug here. `bidi-js` is
      deliberately not imported.

   2. `var(--art-veil)` - SAME TRAP, same fix. An `<img>` pointing at an SVG is
      an isolated document: it has no `:root`, so the custom property never
      resolves and the full-bleed veil rect falls back to the SVG initial fill,
      which is BLACK. A perfectly drawn scene under an opaque black rectangle.
      `resolveVars` below is our own copy of `artSvgSized`'s replacement, NOT an
      import - the app may never import `src/build/**` (it reads `src/content`,
      and one import puts every word of every page into the precached shell).

   3. `xmlns` - SAME TRAP. `gameArt` emits a FRAGMENT meant to be inlined into
      HTML, where the namespace is implied. As a standalone document it is not
      an SVG at all, and a browser refuses to decode it just as resvg does.

   And two that are new here, because a build machine has neither:

   4. NO BUNDLED FONT. `ogImages.ts` reads two Heebo binaries off disk and hands
      them to satori. An SVG inside an `<img>` cannot fetch anything - and this
      platform forbids an external request from a game regardless - so the card
      names a SYSTEM stack and the device draws Hebrew with its own Hebrew font.
      That is why nothing here measures text: we do not know the metrics, so
      lines are CAPPED by character count rather than fitted.

   5. NO `<foreignObject>`. It taints a canvas in some engines, and a tainted
      canvas makes `toBlob` throw - so the rasteriser would fail at the last
      step, after everything looked right. Plain shapes and `<text>` only.

   The rasteriser lives in `shareCardRender.ts`; this file stays DOM-free so the
   layout is unit-testable without a browser. */

 *
 * `ui/ink.ts` is the module that already owns "a strip sits on a colour and
 * something has to stay readable on it", and it is exempt from that gate for
 * exactly this reason. Deriving the ink rather than picking it means the pair
 * stays legible if the bar ever moves: measured 15.9:1, well past AA.

 * It is a shade off `ogCard.ts`'s `#241C3B`, so a link unfurl and a sent
