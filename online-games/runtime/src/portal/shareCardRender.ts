/* Turning the card SVG into a PNG a chat app will accept - the BROWSER half.
   ===========================================================================

   `src/build/ogImages.ts` does this job at build time with satori and resvg.
   Neither exists here: both are native Node packages, and one of them alone is
   larger than this app's entire first visit. The browser already owns a text
   shaper, a bidi implementation and a rasteriser, so the whole job is: hand an
   `<img>` an SVG, draw it to a canvas, ask the canvas for PNG bytes.

   FOUR THINGS THAT MAKE THIS FAIL SILENTLY, all of them handled below:

   1. A TAINTED CANVAS. `toBlob` throws a SecurityError on a canvas that has
      drawn anything cross-origin. An SVG from a blob: URL with no external
      references does not taint - which is the other reason `shareCard.ts` may
      not reference a webfont, quite apart from the no-network rule.
   2. A LEAKED OBJECT URL. `createObjectURL` pins the blob for the life of the
      document. A sheet opened repeatedly would hold every card it ever drew.
   3. AN `<img>` THAT NEVER SETTLES. A malformed SVG fires `onerror`; a decoder
      that simply never answers fires neither. The timeout is what stops a share
      button spinning for the rest of the session.
   4. `toBlob` ANSWERING `null`. It is allowed to, and the signature says so.
      Treated as a failure rather than dereferenced.

   NOTHING HERE THROWS. A card that cannot be drawn resolves to `null`, and the
   sheet then offers the link on its own and SAYS SO - same discipline as
   `speech.ts` and `analytics.ts`, and the reason is the same: a picture is an
   enrichment, and an enrichment must never break the thing it enriches. */
