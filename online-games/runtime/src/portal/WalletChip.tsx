   * 2026-08-25, on a width argument recorded here as measured fact:
   * "coins+stars wraps the header to two rows at 320, 360, 390 and 430 alike".
   *
   * That measurement was real and its ATTRIBUTION was wrong. Re-run live at
   * 390px changing one variable at a time:
   *
   *     stars  0  ->  header  76px   ONE row
   *     stars 24  ->  header 122px   TWO rows
   *     stars  5  ->  header  76px   ONE row     (reverses cleanly)

   * The bar wraps when the STAR count reaches two digits. Coins were never in
   * it - a chip with coins restored, at 320px, on a four-digit balance,
   * overflows nothing and clips nothing. A number measured without a
   * one-variable control is a hypothesis that reads like a finding, and this
   * one then cost the operator a control they wanted:
   * `.claude/rules/a-threshold-tuned-against-todays-tree-goes-stale.md`.
   *
   * Operator ruling 2026-08-25: "add back coins". The prop stays because it is
   * supported and harmless, and because a surface may yet want a stars-only
   * readout for a reason that is actually about stars.
   *
   * This chip is the flyTo anchor either way. A coin granted while a game is
   * mounted flies to the game page's own chip, which is `bare` and whole.

          is already a deep tone of the game's own ground, so an orange coin
          and a yellow star on top of it are two more accents competing with
          the one colour the bar exists to show - and `--orange-ink` is tuned
