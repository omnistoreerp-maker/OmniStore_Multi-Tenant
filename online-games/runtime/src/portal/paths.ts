 * Pages. Every href here carries it; nothing that identifies a page does.
 *
 * Every function here takes a `PageLocale` and not a `Locale`, and the two
 * stopped being the same type on 2026-08-16. These build the address of an
 * EMITTED DOCUMENT, so they follow the list of languages that have documents -
 * not the narrower list of languages whose authored strings ship in the bundle.
 * `pageLocaleFor()` is the funnel: the app may be speaking one of eleven
