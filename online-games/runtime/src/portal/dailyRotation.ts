// The rule is pure and lives in `@sdk/daily` (`dailyPick`); the ROSTER is a
// fact about the catalogue, which the SDK is below in the module graph. This
// module is the binding between them, and it is deliberately the only one:
// `createContext` calls it to decide whether a mounting game is the daily, and
// `Home` calls it to draw the card. Two derivations would be two answers to
// "what is today's puzzle", and they would disagree at midnight.
//
// IMPORTS `@sdk/daily` DIRECTLY, NEVER `@sdk/index`. `createContext.ts` imports
// this file, and `@sdk/index` re-exports `createContext` — so reaching for the
// barrel here would close a runtime import cycle. `daily.ts` itself imports
// only `@shared/rng` and `./profile`, neither of which comes back this way.
