/* The share sheet - a picture, a line of text, and an honest button.
   ===========================================================================

   THE STANDARD THIS SCREEN IS HELD TO
   `.claude/rules/destructive-actions-show-both-sides.md`: never present a
   promise the platform has not made. Sharing is not destructive, but it has the
   same shape - the thing that decides whether it works is outside this app, and
   the tempting UI is one button labelled "Share" that does something different
   on every device and says nothing when it does less.

   So the LABEL IS COMPUTED FROM CAPABILITY, before the tap:

     navigator.share missing        -> the button says "Copy link", because that
                                       is what it is going to do.
     share, but not with files      -> the button says "Share" and a line under
                                       it says this device sends the link only.
     both                           -> "Share", picture attached.

   And the card is rendered ON OPEN rather than on tap. Two reasons, and the
   second is the load-bearing one: the button cannot honestly say what it will
   do until the file exists, AND Safari drops transient activation across an
   await - so a handler that rasterises first and calls `navigator.share`
   afterwards is refused by iOS as a share with no user gesture behind it. */
