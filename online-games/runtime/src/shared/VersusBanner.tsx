// Whose turn it is, said WITHOUT A WORD.
//
// This is the one screen in the app a pre-reader has to read, so it says the
// same thing four ways at once and none of them is text:
//
//   COLOUR   the active seat's card is tinted with that seat's colour and ringed
//            in the full accent — the same colour their pieces wear on the board.
//   SIZE     the active card is bigger, and so is the face on it.
//   MOTION   the active card pulses (`ellaz-pulse`, already in global.css).
//   A FACE   each player is an animal, from `sdk/names.ts`. A four-year-old who
//            cannot read "Swift Tiger" can absolutely tell a tiger from a frog.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: the waiting card is NOT dimmed. Four signals already say
// whose turn it is, and a fifth that fades the other player is the only one that
// reads as a penalty rather than as a pointer — on a screen whose whole job is
// that losing does not feel like losing. Dropping it also removes a contrast
// problem it had quietly created: `--text-dim` behind 62% opacity falls under
// the 4.5:1 floor, and the pairing on a plain surface is already measured.
//
// The words that ARE here are for the adult in the room and for a screen
// reader: an `aria-label` on the banner saying whose turn it is, and a label on
// the mode button. Nothing a child needs is spelled.
//
// It lives in `src/shared/` and not in `src/ui/` on purpose. `src/ui/` is
// pinned to the SHELL chunk (see the `manualChunks` comments in vite.config.ts),
// so a component there is downloaded by every child on their first visit —
// before they have chosen a game, let alone invited a sibling. `src/shared/` is
// the `page-*` chunk, which is exactly the right lifetime for this.
