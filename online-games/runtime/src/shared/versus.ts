// Pass-and-play — two people, one device, taking turns.
//
// PURE: no DOM, no React, no storage, no clock. Everything here is a function
// from a state to a state, driven by an injectable rng, so the whole of
// "whose turn is it and who is ahead" is unit-testable without a browser.
//
// WHY THIS IS ONE MODULE AND NOT A RULE PER GAME
// The same shape it shares with `economy.ts` and `score.ts`: a game reports
// WHAT HAPPENED — a pair was taken, a line was made, the board filled up — and
// this module alone decides what that does to the turn, to the tally, and to
// who opens the next match. A game cannot invent its own turn order, cannot
// decide that losing costs something, and cannot say what a match is worth.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT
//   - No `spend`, no subtraction, no negative anywhere. `take` and `finish` only
//     ever add, exactly like RewardsPort has no `spend()`. A losing child can
//     never watch a number go down.
//   - No text entry, anywhere, for anything. Both players are DRAWN from the
//     name pool. See the header of `sdk/names.ts`: nothing a child can type is
//     the reason this platform has no moderation problem, and a two-player mode
//     is precisely where a "what's your name?" box would have crept in.
//   - No score, no personal best, no leaderboard. See `versusWinOptions`.
import type { Locale } from "@i18n/index";
// DIRECT module path, not `@sdk/index`. The barrel pulls the whole SDK in — the
// wallet, the profile, cloud sync — where all this needs is the name pool, and
// `names.ts` itself imports only `@shared/rng` (a leaf). Same discipline the
// comment above the import in `names.ts` spells out, pointed the other way.
