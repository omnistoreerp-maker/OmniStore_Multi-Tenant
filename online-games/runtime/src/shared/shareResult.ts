// The win-screen share chip's plumbing - what game is being played, and the
// pure text for what just happened, both handed to the portal layer without
// this file ever touching the DOM.
//
// Two halves, on purpose:
//
//   THE PURE HALF (`resultLineFor`) turns a run's ScoreReport plus whether it
//   was a personal best into ONE LINE OF TEXT - "New best: 14" - the exact
//   shape `buildGameInvite` in `sdk/share.ts` expects on `GameInvite.resultLine`.
//   Labels are handed in already resolved to the reader's language, the same
//   discipline `buildGameInvite`'s own `InviteLabels` holds itself to: this file
//   has no opinion about which of twelve languages the reader speaks.
//
//   THE WIRING HALF is two module-level registries, the same shape
//   `portal/WalletChip.tsx`'s anchor registry already uses for the same reason:
//   `winMoment()` runs inside `src/shared`, which knows nothing about a game's
//   id, its title, or its own portal chrome - a game only ever talks to
//   GameContext. `GameHost` registers what IT knows (which game, its title, its
//   page) when a game mounts, and a handler for what to DO about a win; winMoment
//   reports that a win happened and what it scored, and neither side needs to
//   know whether the other exists. A hand-built test context, the standalone
//   bundle (see GameHost's variant guard), or a win fired before GameHost
//   finished registering all resolve to the same thing: nothing listens, so
//   nothing happens.
//
// PURE where it can be, so `resultLineFor` is unit-testable with no browser at
// all - the same reason `sdk/share.ts` stays DOM-free.
