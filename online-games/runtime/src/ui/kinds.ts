/**
 * THE BUTTON KIT - every button kind this app draws, and the settings each one
 * reads (games-doctrine G8, operator ruling 2026-09-28: "we always generalize
 * buttons and make them modular so we can change them easily as we wish").
 *
 * A kind is drawn in ONE place, and every look it has - fill, ink, edge,
 * shape, shadow, type, tilt, how it moves when pressed - is read from its
 * settings with Day's value as the fallback:
 *
 *     background: ${K("lid-fill", "rgba(255,255,255,.12)")}
 *               = background: var(--lid-fill,rgba(255,255,255,.12))
 *
 * So a theme, or a whole new style, is a LIST OF SETTINGS and nothing else:
 *
 *     :root[data-theme="wood"] body { --lid-fill: #8a5a33; --lid-radius: 4px; }
 *
 * Set them on `body` (or `:root[data-theme=x] body`): the game colour `--g`
 * lives on <body>, so a setting that reads it resolves there. A sheet may also
 * vary a setting by POSITION (`.ellaz-key:nth-child(3n) { --key-bg: ... }`) -
 * that is still a setting. What a sheet may not do is give a button a look
 * directly; `button-kit.test.ts` counts every rule that does, and the count
 * only goes down.
 *
 * A kind that exists in the code and not here is a button no style can reach;
 * a setting here that nothing reads is a lever with no caller. The kit test
 * holds both directions. This module imports nothing: the page chunk
 * (GameTable) and the document emitter (src/build/layout.ts) both read it.
