/**
 * The one screen shape every game wears.
 *
 * Chosen by the operator on 2026-08-08 after four rounds of rendered options.
 * Three things about it are decisions, not defaults, and each cost a round:
 *
 * 1. THE CONTROLS ARE ON TOP. Never at the bottom.
 *
 * 2. THE DIFFICULTY IS A TOGGLE THAT NEVER GETS A ROW OF ITS OWN. One card
 *    showing the CURRENT level; each tap advances to the next. It shares the
 *    button row and absorbs that row's leftover width, so the row has no slack
 *    to show. A full-width difficulty band was measured, seen, and rejected.
 *
 * 3. THE BOTTOM REGION IS REAL, NOT PADDING. On a 390px phone a square board is
 *    WIDTH-bound at 366px, so ~350px of vertical space exists that no board can
 *    ever occupy - and shrinking the chrome makes that hole BIGGER, not smaller.
 *    `footer` is where a game's own secondary controls belong: sudoku's number
 *    pad, sequence's choice row. A game with nothing to put there says something
 *    useful instead (whose turn it is). Measured: 176px of dead band before,
 *    122px after.
 *
 * And one measurement worth keeping, because every size check passed while the
 * screen looked wrong: a control's problem was not its SIZE, it was how much of
 * it was INK. A 118x62 slab holding a 22px glyph is 6.7% icon and 93% empty
 * button. The square 56px buttons here sit at ~27%, where a standard 24px icon
 * in a 48px button lands. If you widen a nav button, grow the glyph with it.

 * measured 2026-08-21, 25 different row shapes across 33 games. Tracks fix
 * that by construction rather than by tuning.
 *
 * It also retires the FLOORS. A `min-width` on a grid item overflows its track
 * instead of wrapping the row, so `--gc-level-min` and `--gc-stat-min` are
 * gone and every cell is `minWidth: 0`. The row cannot wrap now because there
 * is nothing to wrap: three tracks, always, whatever is in them.
 *
 * The ratio is 1.8 / 1 / 0.9 because the difficulty is the only cell carrying
 * a WORD and the third is usually a short counter.
 *
 * IT WAS 1.25 / 1 / 0.85, AND 1.25 WAS NEVER REACHING THE DIFFICULTY. The nav
 * buttons were the row's first children, so each one took a whole track - see
 * the note by the flex wrapper below. Once they moved out, track one is the
 * difficulty's for the first time and the ratio could be argued from what the
 * cell actually needs.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-30, on the built artifacts at 390px, all 42 games plus the
 * three standalone bundles:
 *
 *   snake, standalone, one nav   "Normal"   needs 128px  <- the binding case
 *     1.25 -> 111  CLIPPED "Nor..."     1.6 -> 126  CLIPPED
 *     1.5  -> 124  CLIPPED             1.8 -> 134  clear, by 6px
 *   2048,  standalone, one nav   "Classic"  needs 121px
 *     1.25 -> 117  CLIPPED "Cla..."     1.8 -> 141  clear
 *   all 42 in the APP            rowW 355, no navs in the row at all
 *     1.25 -> nothing clipped anywhere   1.8 -> nothing clipped anywhere
 *
 * SIX PIXELS IS THIN, and the bound is narrower than it looks: the standalone
 * is hardcoded `lang="en"`, so only English labels are ever measured against
 * it, and the app - where Hebrew labels live - has 355px and no navs, which is
 * slack of a different order. Re-measure before adding a level label longer
 * than "Normal" to a game that ships standalone.
 *
 * WHAT NO RATIO CAN FIX, and what does: snake WHILE PLAYING carries a second
 * nav, leaving the grid 227px. "Normal" alone wants 128 of it, and two numbers
 * want the rest. Measured at 1.8, 2.2 and 2.6 - every one clips. FIXED
 * 2026-08-30 by wrapping instead of shrinking: the flex wrapper below wraps
 * and `.gc-row` carries a measured basis, so the row takes its own line rather
 * than losing letters. The ratio here is unchanged and still does the work
 * whenever the row does fit on one line.

            than a tidy-up. They used to be the row's first children, so each
            one CONSUMED a flexible track: measured on the built 2048 bundle at
            390px, the restart icon is 56px wide and was sitting in the 1.25fr
            track at 142.9px, wasting 87 of them, while the difficulty was
            pushed into the 1fr track at 114.3px and rendered "Cla...". The
            value needed 52px and had 45.

            The ratio above says in its own words that 1.25 exists "because the
            difficulty is the only cell carrying a WORD" - which was true when
            it was written and stopped being true the moment a nav button
            joined the row. Snake in play carries TWO navs and lost two tracks.

            An `auto` track per nav does not work: the count varies from 0 to 2,
            and the cells wrap, so row two would start in a nav-sized track.
            A flex wrapper leaves the grid exactly three tracks whatever the
            navs do. `.gc-row` stays the grid, so `panelRead.ts`, the design
            bench's `.ellaz-game-panel .gc-row` selector and every `--gc-*`

            paused game cannot be played through its own cover.

            One tap anywhere on it resumes. The whole surface is the target
            because that is what a four-year-old aims at, and the button inside
            is what says so - it is drawn, not wired, and the click it would
            handle is caught by this parent either way. */}

/**
 * FIT THE SIDE COLUMNS. ON A PC, A GAME'S SIDE COLUMNS ARE AS TALL AS THE BOARD, AND WHAT IS IN THEM FITS.
 *
 * `.ellaz-game-footer` and `.ellaz-game-side` sit beside the board in a row the
 * board sets the height of (`contain: size` in global.css). When a game puts
 * more in a column than that row holds, there were two answers before this and
 * both hid a control: `overflow-y: auto` put maze's down arrow behind a
 * scrollbar at 1024x768, and `overflow: visible` would hang coloring's palette
 * off the bottom of the window. Measured on live ellaz.fun 2026-09-14 by
 * `scripts/repro/repro-controls-stay-on-screen.mjs`: 5 games, 1024 to 1536 wide.
 *
 * So the column's content is SCALED down until it fits, never scrolled and never
 * cut. A transform and not `zoom`: a transform does not change the layout box
 * this measures, so the reading cannot chase its own answer.
 *
 * A phone never scales - it scrolls its page, and a phone's controls sit under
 * the board where the page gives them all the height they ask for. Same 900px
 * as every other PC rule, read live so a resized window changes arm.
 *
 * It lives in this file on purpose: as its own module Rollup hoisted it into the
 * SHELL chunk, +249 B gz on every first visit for a function only a game page
 * runs (measured 2026-09-14, two builds of one tree).
