/**
 * The app's icon set. Inline SVG, `stroke="currentColor"`, one geometry.
 *
 * Every glyph is drawn on the SAME 24-unit grid at the SAME 2.1 stroke weight,
 * with round caps and joins. That uniformity is the whole point and it is not
 * decoration: the set this replaced mixed solid fills (home, star) with hairline
 * stroked arcs (speaker), so the home read heavy beside the speaker and the row
 * looked collected rather than drawn. Nobody can say which icon is wrong when
 * that happens - they just say the screen looks cheap.
 *
 * So: adding an icon means drawing it at 2.1 on the 24 grid with round caps. An
 * icon that needs a different weight to look right is drawn wrong, not weighted
 * wrong.
 *
 * Emoji are not an option here - they cannot take `currentColor`, they render
 * differently on every OS, and they carry no accessible name.
