// It replaces two byte-identical copies of the same `dpadBtn` helper (snake and
// maze), which laid the keys out as a two-row block — up on its own, then
// left/DOWN/right in one line. That reads as three keys and a hat: a child
// reaching for "down" lands between "left" and "right", which is the one

// THE ARROWS ARE THE CONTRACT AND THE JOYSTICK IS THE EXTRA. Kids games here
// are tap-completable and drag is never REQUIRED (CLAUDE.md § kids games), so
// every direction stays a plain <button> with its own label; the stick is
// `aria-hidden` and adds nothing a tap cannot already do. A five-year-old on a
// phone, or anyone on assistive input, cannot reliably hold a sustained pointer
// gesture — so if this component ever ships with the arrows removed, the games
// on it are broken for exactly the players this platform is for.
// The one sanctioned exception (operator ruling 2026-09-14): `variant: "stick"`,
// shown only behind a game's Controls setting whose Arrows choice is the default
// and always one tap away (`ControlModePicker`).

// It lives in `@ui` beside `GameChrome` and `DifficultySelector`, and like
// `GameChrome` it is pinned to the `page` chunk in vite.config.ts — every game
// that draws a pad is on a page that has already fetched `page-*`, and the
// `src/{sdk,ui,juice,i18n,shared}` catch-all would otherwise put it in front of
// a child who has not chosen a game yet.
