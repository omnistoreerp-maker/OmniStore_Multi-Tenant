// Jigsaw — PURE rules. No DOM, no React, no canvas, no engine.
//
// Modules are imported by DIRECT path, never through the `@shared` barrel: the
// barrel re-exports `Prompt` and `winMoment`, which pull React and the portal
// in, and `src/games/logic-is-pure.test.ts` fails the build on it.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE RULES NEVER SEE THE PICTURE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
//
// A jigsaw looks like it is about an image, so the obvious shape is a module
// that knows about SVG. This one holds a PERMUTATION and nothing else: piece
// `n` belongs in slot `n`, the board is solved when every slot holds its own
// piece, and which drawing is being cut up is an integer this file never
// interprets. The renderer owns the picture entirely.
//
// That split is what keeps `logic.ts` importable in node with no DOM — the
// purity gate would refuse `@ui/gameArt` outright — and it is also what makes
// the game cost nothing to extend: another picture is one more entry in the
// renderer's list, with no rule to change and no test to update.
//
// TAP, NEVER DRAG. There is no `drag(from, to)` here at all. A tap picks a
// piece up and a tap on a slot puts it down, which is the kids rule in
// CLAUDE.md and the accessible path besides — a five-year-old on a phone, and
// anyone on assistive input, cannot reliably hold a sustained pointer gesture.
// Drag may be layered ON TOP of this later; it may never replace it.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
