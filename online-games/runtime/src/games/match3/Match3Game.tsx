// The renderer. Every rule about what a tap DOES lives in logic.ts; this file
// decides what a tap LOOKS and SOUNDS like, and what the outcomes it reports
// are worth to the economy.
//
// TAP FIRST, SWIPE ON TOP. The first tap picks a gem up and a second tap on a
// neighbour trades them; a swipe does the same trade in one motion. The tap
// path is the one that may never be lost — a five-year-old on a phone, and
// anyone on assistive input, cannot reliably hold a sustained pointer gesture
// (CLAUDE.md § kids games), and every cell is a real `<button>`, so a keyboard
// reaches every swap the gesture does. `logic.test.ts` pins that equivalence
// rather than leaving it to this comment.
//
// The gesture is DECIDED HERE AND RESOLVED THERE: this file turns a pointer
// into a direction, and `swipeCell` turns a direction into the same `swapAt`
// the taps call. A swipe cannot acquire rules of its own, because it has
// nowhere to put them.
//
// THE ANIMATION IS A REPLAY, NOT A STATE MACHINE. `tapCell` returns a board
// that is already settled plus the list of steps that got there, so everything
// below is decoration over a decided outcome. `busy` locks input while the
// cascade plays, and it lives in React state and NEVER in `Match3State` — a
// lock that reaches the disk is `memory`'s 850 ms bug, which restored a board
// that refused every card and looked completely normal
// (session-snapshot-convention.md).

 * fills on 2026-09-05: `#12172B` scores 4.06 (purple) to 11.38 (yellow), so
 * every one clears the 3:1 floor a graphical object needs. White scores 1.56
 * on the yellow gem, 1.87 on the green and 2.20 on the blue - it fails four of
 * the six, and the one it looks best on is the one nobody would have checked.
 *
 * The rainbow's arms are 5 units wide, not 8. Three widths were rendered side
 * by side on the real hexagon at both 136px and the board's own 41px
 * (2026-09-05): at 8 the eight-point star fills in and reads as a dark BLOB at
 * board size, at 6 the points are visible, and at 5-and-shorter it is still an
 * asterisk. Only the small arm matters - all three are identical at 136px,
 * which is the size nobody plays at.
 *
 * Every mark stays inside a circle of radius ~17 about the middle, which is
 * the largest disc that fits inside the TRIANGLE gem - the tightest of the six.
 * A mark drawn wider than the gem it sits on spills onto the dark well, where
 * a dark ink is invisible, and the ring appears broken on exactly one colour.

 * What a power-up going off LOOKS like, per kind.
 *
 * Until 2026-09-05 every cleared cell played the same 0.16 s fade whether a

 * the two apart was a board shake on two of the four kinds. A player asked for
 * the effect to match the effect; the operator then ruled that each power gets
 * its OWN motion rather than one shape in four sizes. So:
 *
 *   stripe   two heads race out from the gem to each edge, each dragging a
 *            tail. The row is never fully lit at once, so you can still see
 *            WHICH gem fired.
 *   burst    a ring pushes outward through the three-by-three it clears.
 *   rainbow  a head flies from the gem to every square the rainbow is taking,
 *            each one carrying that square's own colour - which is why a
 *            rainbow onto a rainbow throws the whole board's colours at once.
 *
 * Every one of them is drawn in the GEM'S colour rather than in white. White
 * was the first version and the operator's word for it was "lame": it reads as
 * a flash on the glass rather than as the gem doing something.
 *
 * Drawn from `CascadeStep.fired`, which carries the index and the kind, plus
 * the step's own `cleared` list and the board still on screen - the cleared
 * cells cannot say which power sent them, and by the time the next grid lands
 * their colours are gone.
 *
 * Under `prefers-reduced-motion` it renders nothing at all. The sound, the
 * shake and the clear all still happen - this is the decoration.
