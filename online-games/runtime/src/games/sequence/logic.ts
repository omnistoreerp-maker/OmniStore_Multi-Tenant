// "What comes next?" — pattern continuation for 4-6 year olds. PURE logic:
// zero DOM, zero React, zero Phaser. Everything is driven by an injectable `rng`
// (LAST parameter, defaulting to `Math.random`) so a seeded generator replays a
// round exactly, which is what the tests lean on.
//
// A round is a row of visible items with the last slot blank, plus 3-4 answer
// choices. The child taps the one that continues the pattern.
//
// THE DISTRACTORS ARE THE GAME. A round with unrelated glyphs in the choice row
// is trivial (the odd one out IS the answer), and a round whose distractor is
// indistinguishable from the answer is unfair. So every wrong choice here is one
// of two things: another element OF THE PATTERN (preferred, always offered first
// when one exists), or a near-sibling from the same visual family — a different
// colour from the same palette, a different shape in the same colour, the same
// character at the other size, a number one step off. `logic.test.ts` pins both
// halves: exactly one choice equals the answer, and no other choice does.
