// THE FROG AND THE PADS ARE INLINE SVG, NOT EMOJI. 🐸 is drawn by whichever
// emoji font the device ships, so its size and silhouette vary per platform —
// and this game asks a four-year-old to spot ONE small thing on a busy pond in
// about a second. Drawing it means the target looks the same everywhere, and it
// can squash and stretch, which is what makes a hop read as a hop.
//
// THERE IS NO GAME LOOP IN THIS FILE AND THERE MUST NEVER BE ONE. The hop is
// DECLARED to the Web Animations API as keyframes and interpolated by the
// compositor at the display's real refresh rate; a hand-rolled `1000/60`
// accumulator driven by requestAnimationFrame freezes every second frame on a
// 120 Hz screen and reads as input lag. See `@shared/spawn.ts` and
// `.claude/rules/fixed-timestep-must-match-display.md`.

   * centred by transform would sit half its own width down and right of its pad
