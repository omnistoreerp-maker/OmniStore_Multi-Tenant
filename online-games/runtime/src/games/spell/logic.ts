// "Spell the Word" (מרכיבים מילה) - pure logic.
//
// A picture is shown and the child builds its whole name, letter by letter,
// from a tray of tiles. This is the step up from `letters`, which asks only
// which letter a word BEGINS with: here every letter of the word has to be
// found, in order.
//
// THE ONE DESIGN DECISION EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS FROM: a wrong tile is never
// PLACED. Tapping it shakes and rules that tile out for the current slot, and
// the word on screen is therefore correct at every moment a child looks at it.
//
// The alternative - let them fill all the slots and check at the end - is how
// spelling is tested rather than how it is learned, and for a four-year-old it
// ends in a row of letters that is wrong in a way nobody can point at. It also
// removes an entire feature: with nothing wrong ever placed, there is nothing
// to take back, so the game needs no undo, no drag, and no way to get stuck.
//
// PURE: no DOM, no React, no timers. Imports go to the DIRECT shared modules
// (`@shared/rng`), the leaf `@i18n/locales`, and this game's own pure `./words`
// - never the `@shared` barrel and never `@ui`/`@juice`.
