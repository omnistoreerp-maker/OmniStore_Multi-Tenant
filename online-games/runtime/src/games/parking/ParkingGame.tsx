 * end, and a solved board is never handed back: `live: !won` clears it, and the
 * guard at the mount refuses one anyway. The day this game pays anything
 * mid-run — a milestone, a personal best — that latch belongs here, or leaving
 * and returning becomes a way to be paid twice (see the session rule).
 *
 * Nothing about the DRIVE-OUT is stored either, and that is the other half of
 * the same rule: `driving` is a state only a `setTimeout` leaves, so a snapshot
 * caught inside it would restore a car halfway through the wall with no timer
 * behind it. It cannot reach the disk, because `won` and `driving` are set in
