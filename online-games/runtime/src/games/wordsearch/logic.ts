// Word Search - pure logic. A square of letters hides a list of words; the
// player marks each one by tapping its first letter and then its last, or by
// dragging between the two. No timer pressure, no way to lose, nothing to
// undo - a wrong selection simply is not a word.
//
// PURE: no DOM, no React, no timers. Imports go to the DIRECT shared modules
// (`@shared/rng`), the leaf `@i18n/locales`, and this game's own pure `./words`.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE GRID IS BUILT WORDS-FIRST, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
//
// The obvious generator scatters letters and then looks to see what turned up.
// It is also the one that hands a child a list containing a word that is not
// there, and a child cannot tell an absent word from a well-hidden one. They
// keep looking, they give up, and the thing that lied to them is the game.
//
// So `deal` PLACES every word first, at a real cell in a real direction, and
// only then fills what is left. The list it returns IS the set of words it
// managed to place, so "every listed word is on the board" is a property of the
// construction rather than a claim about it. Nothing is ever added to the list
// afterwards, and if a word will not fit it is simply not on the list.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ACCIDENTAL OCCURRENCE, AND WHICH WAY WE RESOLVED IT.
//
// Filler letters can spell a listed word somewhere the generator never intended.
// It is not rare and it is not a bug - it is what a bag of common letters does.
// Two ways out:
//
//   (a) accept ANY occurrence of a listed word, wherever it turns up;
//   (b) re-fill the grid until no unplanned occurrence exists.
//
// THIS GAME DOES (a), and the reason is the child rather than the code. Under
// (b) the game is still refusing a correct find at the moment of the re-fill's
// failure - and worse, (b) is a loop with no bound: on a 12x12 Hebrew grid
// carrying ten short words, "no accidental occurrence anywhere in 144 squares
// times eight directions" is a condition a weighted filler may take a very long
// time to satisfy, and a deal that hangs is worse than one that is generous.
//
// Under (a) there is nothing to refuse. `judge` reads the letters the player
// actually selected and asks whether they spell a listed word that is still
// missing - it never compares the selection against a stored answer key. A word
// found in the filler is found. `logic.test.ts` plants one deliberately and
// requires it to be accepted, and `scripts/sim/wordsearch-grids.mjs` measures
// how often the situation arises for real.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HEBREW READS THE OTHER WAY, AND THE BOARD DOES NOT MIRROR.
//
// The grid carries `dir="ltr"` like every spatial grid in this app, so cell
// `row * size + col` is always drawn at the same place whatever the interface
// language (.claude/rules/rtl-spatial-grid-dir-ltr.md). If Hebrew words were
// then planted left to right, every one of them would read BACKWARDS to the
// person looking for it.
//
// So the direction set is defined against the language's own READING SENSE:
// `readingSense` is +1 for the Latin scripts and -1 for Hebrew, and every
// horizontal or diagonal direction is expressed as a multiple of it. "Across"
// therefore means left-to-right in English and right-to-left in Hebrew, which is
// what "across" means to each of those readers, and "reversed" is the awkward
// direction in both. Vertical is top-to-bottom in all three: Hebrew is written
// right to left horizontally and top to bottom down the page.
//
// `logic.test.ts` pins this from both ends, because the failure is silent - a
// Hebrew grid planted the Latin way renders perfectly and is simply unreadable.

 * The operator's rule, the same one `letters` and `spell` carry: a Hebrew
 * interface can practise all three scripts, every other interface gets the two
 * Latin ones.
 *
 * Deliberately a copy rather than an import from another game. Games talk to the
 * SDK and never to each other, and this is one map of three entries - coupling
 * three games' difficulty design together to save it would be the more expensive
 * mistake. Data-driven either way, so it reds by name when the shipped set grows.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE OTHER HALF OF THE HEBREW DIRECTION ANSWER. Planting Hebrew
 * right-to-left makes a Hebrew grid readable; the toggle makes it a CHOICE, so a
 * Hebrew-speaking child can hunt English words without changing the language of
 * every button on the screen, and an English-speaking one is never handed a grid
 * of letters they cannot read.
