/**
 * Lettercross - "fill the missing letters in the word in front of you". PURE:
 * no DOM, no React, no timers.
 *
 * The fourth of BONUS's five bonus screens, and the first one it gave NO
 * numbers for - the record has a clock and a price for the other four and a "?"
 * for this. So both are borrowed rather than invented, and each borrowing is
 * named where it happens: the clock below, the price in `fillQuality`.
 *
 * TWO GAPS, and the count is a measurement rather than a taste. Asked of the
 * 346-word pool, how many blanked patterns have EXACTLY ONE dictionary answer:
 *
 *   1 gap    499 patterns   - but that IS the shared-letter round with one word
 *   2 gaps   275 patterns   - 85 five-letter, 190 six-letter
 *   3 gaps    39 patterns   - 36 of them six-letter, so the round repeats itself
 *
 * One gap is disqualified on design rather than on supply: a single missing
 * letter in a single word is `sharedLetter.ts` with the other lines deleted, so
 * two of the five screens would be the same screen. Three is disqualified on
 * supply - 39 puzzles is a round a child sees twice in an evening.
 *
 * Note what the 2-gap row does NOT contain: nothing shorter than five letters.
 * Take two letters out of `frog` and what is left cannot single out a word, so
 * the generator never has to exclude short words - the uniqueness test does it.
 *
 * EXACTLY ONE ANSWER IS WHAT MAKES THE GENEROUS RULE AND THE STRICT RULE THE
 * SAME RULE. A player who fills the gaps with some other real word has not
 * cheated and must not be told no; a round that only accepts the word it was
 * thinking of would refuse them. Requiring uniqueness up front means there is no
 * other real word, so "accept any word" and "accept the answer" cannot disagree
 * and the round needs only one of them.
 *
 * The two lists are `sharedLetter.ts`'s, for its reasons: the word SHOWN comes
 * from `puzzleWords.ts`, the answer is CHECKED against `words.ts`.

/**
 * The letters to offer.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A NEAR MISS ON THIS ROUND, and that is a theorem
 * rather than a shortcoming - it is worth reading before "improving" the row.
 *
 * The obvious decoy is a letter that would complete ONE gap with the other one
 * already correct. That set is always EMPTY here. Filling the other gap with its
 * true letter and finding some letter `c` that completes the rest gives a real
 * word which matches the whole pattern - so it is an answer of the pattern, and
 * the pattern was chosen to have exactly one. Measured, because a theorem you
 * have not run is a belief: 400 single-gap completions across 200 puzzles, zero
 * alternatives. `fill-gaps.test.ts` pins it.
 *
 * So the row cannot be made to argue with the player, and the round is not
 * elimination - it is RECOGNITION. `n_g_t` is a question about whether you can
 * see `night`, which is the right question to ask a five-year-old and the reason
 * this screen is in a children's game at all. The row's job is to be a keyboard
 * small enough for a phone.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THE PADDING IS NOT RANDOM. Eight letters drawn uniformly from the
 * alphabet arrive carrying `q`, `x` and `z` about a third of the time, and a row
 * with three impossible letters in it has quietly narrowed itself to five. The
 * decoys are drawn from the letters that really do stand at those positions in
 * words of that length - 10 to 20 of them per position - so every letter in the
 * row looks like it belongs.
 *
 * Both answer letters go in first and they may be the SAME letter - `_ipp_r`
 * wants two p's from one button. The row is a set of letters rather than a
 * letter per gap, so a repeat costs a slot instead of taking two.

/**

 * second is the one that decides it.
 *
 * The shape argues for it: one short word and two gaps is the two-word screen's
 * question rather than the three-word screen's, so it is priced like the two.
 *
 * And the direction of the guess is not symmetric. Guessing the price UP hands a
 * child coins the original never promised and quietly re-tunes an economy
 * `economy.ts` owns; guessing it DOWN costs them the difference between two
 * prizes on a screen they still won. When the record is silent, the cheap wrong
 * answer is the one to pick.
 *
 * Not solved pays the floor rather than nothing, for `bonus.ts`'s reason: this
 * platform does not punish, and a player who reached the box with a real word
 * has already earned something.
