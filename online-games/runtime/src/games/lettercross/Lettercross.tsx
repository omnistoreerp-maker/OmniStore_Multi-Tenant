 * The snapshot gate. Handed whatever was on the disk, so it assumes nothing and

 * longer explain. See .claude/rules/session-snapshot-convention.md.
 *
 * IT CARRIES A REWARD LATCH, and that comment used to say the opposite. The
 * claim was "this game grants exactly once, at the end of a run", which stopped
 * being true when the record moved off the end of the run (see `play`). The
 * score only ever climbs, so once a run is above the old best EVERY turn is a
 * new best - without `bestFired` on the disk, walking out and back in re-arms
 * the reward and the run pays a star per resume, for ever.
 *
 * IT CARRIES `reached` FOR THE SAME REASON. A box is collected once, and its
 * square stays filled for the rest of the run - so a snapshot that
 * forgets which boxes are already open re-collects every one of them on the
 * first word after a resume, and walking out and back in is a coin press.
 *
 * AND `rounds`, which is the same argument a third time. A box is marked
 * reached the instant it is arrived at, so a player who walks out mid-round
 * would come back to a collected box and no round - the prize gone with no
 * error anywhere. Carrying the open queue means leaving is a pause.
 *
 * `version` is 6 because the shape has changed five times, most recently when
 * the prize boxes became SQUARES - the board grew from SIZE x SIZE to the whole
 * stage, so every index in an older snapshot means a different square. Nothing
 * is migrated: a half-played
 * board is worth a few minutes, and migration code for it is a second copy of
 * the game's rules that nothing keeps in sync.
