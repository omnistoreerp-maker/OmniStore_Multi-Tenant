/**
 * "Build a word from ALL the letters in front of you" - the fifth and last of
 * BONUS's five screens. 30s, four to six loose letters, 30-100 points by length.
 *
 * TAP A LETTER TO LAY IT DOWN, TAP A LAID LETTER TO TAKE IT BACK. No dragging,
 * for the platform's own reason: a five-year-old on a phone, and anyone on
 * assistive input, cannot reliably hold a sustained pointer gesture, so a bonus
 * round that needed one would be a prize some players cannot open.
 *
 * TILES ARE TAKEN BY POSITION, NEVER BY LETTER. `lake` has one of each and
 * `puppy` does not, so identity has to be the SLOT the tile came from - keying
 * on the character would let one `p` be spent twice while the other sat there.
 *
 * A WRONG WORD POPS THE LAST TILE rather than clearing the line. The player has
 * usually got most of it right and is one letter out; sweeping the whole line
 * would make them lay every tile again, and the thing this round is short of is
 * time. Nothing is taken away and the clock simply keeps running.
 *
 * ANY REAL WORD USING EVERY TILE WINS - `anagram.ts` says why at length: 133 of
 * the 252 words this round can draw share their letters with another word, so
 * accepting only the one we scrambled would refuse a player who built `stale`
 * out of `least`. The reveal still shows OUR word, because a word on a screen
 * comes from `puzzleWords.ts` and never from the dictionary.
 *
 * THE ROUND DECIDES NOTHING. It reduces to a quality and hands it to `onStop`.
