// Pop the Balloons ("פוצצו בלונים") — PURE logic. No DOM, no React, no Phaser.
//
// COLOUR IS THE WHOLE MECHANIC. A prompt names one colour, balloons of every
// colour drift up, and the child pops the ones that match. A wrong tap costs
// NOTHING and this file is where that promise is kept structurally: there is no
// score to lose, no lives counter, no "streak" to break. `isRoundComplete` only
// ever counts UP.
//
// Two decisions carry the game, and both are pinned by `logic.test.ts`:
//
// 1. THE TARGET CANNOT GO MISSING. A child told "pop the red ones" who gets a
//    screen with no red balloon has nothing to do, and at four years old that
//    reads as a broken game rather than as patience. A probability alone cannot
//    promise this — a fair coin runs cold — so after `FORCE_TARGET_AFTER`
//    non-target balloons the next one IS the target, deterministically. The
//    bounded gap, not the rate, is the guarantee.
// 2. EVERY COLOUR CARRIES A SHAPE CUE. `cue` is a mark drawn on the balloon
//    body, distinct per colour, so a red-green colour-blind child plays by the
//    mark and never has to see the difference the prompt is asking about.
//
// Motion is NOT modelled here, deliberately: where a balloon is at any instant
// is declared to the Web Animations API and interpolated by the compositor at
// the display's real refresh rate. See the header of `@shared/spawn.pure`.
//
// The `rng` parameter goes LAST and defaults to `Math.random`, matching every
// other game. Import the pure modules DIRECTLY, never the `@shared` barrel —
// the barrel re-exports React components and this file must stay DOM-free.
