// THE BALLOONS ARE INLINE SVG, NOT EMOJI. 🎈 is one fixed red glyph rendered by
// the OS font, so a "blue balloon" is not expressible with it at all — and the
// colour IS the question here. Drawing them means the hue is a fill attribute
// the logic chooses, and it renders identically on every platform.
//
// COLOUR-BLIND PLAY — WHY EVERY BALLOON CARRIES A SHAPE MARK. Roughly 1 boy in
// 12 cannot reliably separate these hues, and this game's entire question is
// "which colour is this", so hue alone would lock him out while looking fine to
// everyone testing it. Each colour therefore carries its OWN mark on the body
// (sparkle / dots / stripes / heart / zigzag), the prompt shows a full-size
// balloon of the target beside the words, and the prompt can be read aloud. Any
// ONE of those three channels is enough to play. The marks were picked to be
// distinguishable by silhouette rather than by fine detail, because they are
// seen at a glance on something that is moving.
//
// There is NO game loop in this file and there must never be one. Motion is
// declared to the Web Animations API and interpolated by the compositor at the
// display's real refresh rate; a hand-rolled `1000/60` accumulator freezes
// every second frame on a 120 Hz screen. See `@shared/spawn.ts` and
// `.claude/rules/fixed-timestep-must-match-display.md`.

   * Rise, with a sway. TRANSFORM ONLY — never `top`.

   * on the MAIN THREAD every frame, for every balloon alive (six at hard), which
   * is precisely the jank the spawner exists to avoid — see its header, and
   * `.claude/rules/fixed-timestep-must-match-display.md`.
   *
   * The reason `top` is tempting is real: a percentage inside `translateY`
   * resolves against the BALLOON's own height, not the surface, so `translateY(104%)`
   * would move it by one balloon-height rather than one surface-height. The way
   * out is not to abandon transform but to say the distance in the SURFACE's own
   * units — `SURFACE_H` is a plain CSS length, so `calc()` can scale it.
   *
   * `top` stays pinned at RESTING_TOP and the fractions below are measured FROM
   * it: the old 104%/50%/-45% top-values become +62%/+8%/-87% of surface height.
   *
   * These keyframes carry NO centring term, deliberately. A running animation
   * replaces the element's transform outright, so centring had to live in every
   * keyframe while it was a transform — and that is precisely what broke under
   * `prefers-reduced-motion`, where the spawner discards these keyframes for its
   * own scale-only fade and the centring went with them. Centring is a negative
   * margin on the element now (see the style below), which is layout and which
   * no animation can overwrite, so both paths land in the same place.
   *
   * Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the spawner IGNORES this and fades the prop
   * in place — which is why the element's own style parks it at RESTING_TOP,
   * mid-surface and tappable, instead of at the off-screen start of the rise.
