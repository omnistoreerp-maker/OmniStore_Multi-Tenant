// The one Phaser game in the roster, wearing the same chrome as the other
// twenty. Its score, level and speed used to be drawn INSIDE the canvas at
// 20px in a corner, and its speed picker was three Phaser text buttons that
// only existed on the ready screen - so it was the one game where "restart"
// and "change difficulty" were unreachable once a run had started.
//
// React owns the chrome, Phaser owns the canvas, and the scene is the single
// source of truth for every number: it publishes on each `draw`, and the chrome
// only ever asks it to do things (`setSpeed`, `restartFromChrome`).
//
// Phaser is imported LAZILY, inside the effect. A static import would pull 379
// KB of engine into this module's chunk at parse time; snake is the only game
// that imports it at all, and it must stay that way.

// floor to fit it wrapped sudoku instead, whose third cell is a 99px compact
// one: the honest window was [146, 147], one pixel, in English only. Measured
