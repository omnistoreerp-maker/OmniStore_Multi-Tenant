 * sets `lock: true` and the renderer clears it 850ms later. That is fine while
 * the game is on screen and fatal the moment a position is stored, because a
 * snapshot taken inside those 850ms is restored with no timer behind it — and
 * `flip` refuses every card while `lock` is true. The board would come back
 * looking perfectly normal and be permanently unplayable.
 *
 * So a position is settled before it is stored rather than after it is loaded.
 * Settling at save time means the SNAPSHOT can never hold an impossible state;
 * settling at load time would leave the impossible state on disk, one build
 * away from being read by something that forgets to settle it.
 *
 * It costs the player the two cards they had just turned over, which they were
 * about to lose to the timer anyway.
