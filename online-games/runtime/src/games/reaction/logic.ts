// Green Light ("אור ירוק") — PURE rules. No DOM, no React, no Phaser.
//
// A traffic light sits red for an unpredictable while, turns green, and the
// child taps as fast as they can. Two properties carry the whole game, and both
// live in this file:
//
//   1. THE WAIT MUST BE UNPREDICTABLE, AND BOUNDED. If the child can anticipate
//      the change they start moving before it happens, and the number stops
//      being a reaction time — it becomes a measure of how well they guessed.
//      But a wait that is merely LONG fails the other way: a four-year-old will
//      not sit through eight seconds of nothing, and a round they abandon
//      measures nothing at all. So every band is wide (`MIN_SPREAD_MS`) and
//      capped (`WAIT_CEIL_MS`), and the difficulty ladder widens the band rather
//      than lengthening it — nothing about a reaction depends on how long you
//      waited for it.
//
//   2. AN EARLY TAP IS NOT A LOSS. Tapping while the light is still red re-arms
//      it with a fresh wait and says "not yet". There is no failure phase in
//      `Attempt` to reach, which is the structural version of that promise
//      rather than a policy a renderer has to remember. The re-armed wait has a
//      FLOOR (`REARM_MIN_MS`) so a child who is mashing cannot land a tap that
//      happens to arrive just after a very short re-arm and have it recorded as
//      a reaction time.
//
// This file deliberately does NOT use `@shared/spawn.pure`. That module answers
// "when does a prop exist, and did a tap hit the right kind of it" for a STREAM
// of moving props across lanes. Here there is exactly one target, it never
// moves, it never expires, and the only interesting quantity is a TIMESTAMP —
// which the spawner does not model. Wiring it in would mean one lane, a cap of
// one, and an infinite lifetime: every knob neutralised, and a reader misled
// into thinking props are spawning.
//
// Import pure modules by DIRECT path, never the `@shared` barrel — the barrel
// re-exports React components (enforced by `src/games/logic-is-pure.test.ts`).
