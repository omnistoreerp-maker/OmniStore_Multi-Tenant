// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT THIS GAME MEASURES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
//
// The number is `tapTime - greenTime`, and both ends are chosen to avoid
// measuring OUR code instead of the child.
//
// GREEN TIME is taken in a DOUBLE requestAnimationFrame scheduled from a
// `useLayoutEffect` — NOT at the `setState` that turns the light green, where
// the green pixels do not exist yet and timestamping would fold our own render,
// layout and paint into the child's "reaction". The layout effect runs after the
// DOM is mutated and before the paint; the first rAF then fires at the start of
// the frame that paints green, the second at the start of the following frame,
// which is roughly when that frame is presented. We take the SECOND callback's
// own `DOMHighResTimeStamp` (the `performance.now()` timebase), seeding the
// first as a provisional so a tap inside that one-frame window still measures
// something — and measures it LONG, which is the safe direction.
//
// TAP TIME is the pointer event's own `timeStamp`, taken at dispatch, rather
// than `performance.now()` inside the handler, which runs after dispatch and
// after whatever else was queued on the main thread. `readTapTime` falls back to
// `performance.now()` when that stamp is not on the same timebase (some engines
// use epoch ms); the fallback can only make the number longer, never impossible.
//
// WHAT REMAINS, honestly. Display presentation latency — compositor hand-off to
// photons — is NOT observable from JavaScript at all; it is typically another
// one to two frames plus panel response, so the number is systematically
// OPTIMISTIC by roughly 10-40 ms. Touchscreen input sampling adds roughly
// 10-25 ms the other way, PESSIMISTIC; the two partly cancel by an amount nobody
// here can know. rAF timestamps quantise to the frame interval, so there is ±8 ms
// of grain at 120 Hz and ±16 ms at 60 Hz.
//
// So: a CONSISTENT SCORE ON ONE DEVICE, good to maybe ±30-50 ms in absolute
// terms, NOT comparable across devices. Plenty for a child beating their own
// record, which is all the game asks. It is not a laboratory reaction time and
// this file does not claim to be one. None of the above has been measured on
// real hardware — it is reasoning about the pipeline, not a calibration.

 * pointing up for go, an open arrow that says "move" — different silhouettes,
 * not two colours of one silhouette), and BRIGHTNESS (the unlit lamp is nearly
 * black against the housing, the lit one carries a halo).
 *
 * Hue is the fourth cue and the least load-bearing. Original art: a generic
