// Pet - pure rules for a care toy.
//
// THE PET IS NEVER IN TROUBLE. There is no hunger that rises, no sadness that
// sets in, no illness and no death. A child who leaves for a week comes back to
// exactly the pet they left, at exactly the size they grew it to. That is not a
// tuning choice that could go the other way: this is a warm toy, not a
// responsibility simulator, and a creature that suffers for being left alone
// punishes a five-year-old for owning a tablet they do not control.
//
// The cheapest way to GUARANTEE that is for these rules to have no way of
// knowing that time passed. Nothing in this file reads a clock, schedules
// anything, or decays. `logic.test.ts` reads this source and fails the build on
// the name of any wall clock or any scheduler - and it scans the COMMENTS too,
// so this paragraph is careful not to spell one. That is over-strict on
// purpose: a stripper that skipped comments would be a second instrument that
// could be wrong about what it was reading.
//
// AND NOTHING HERE CAN BE STUCK. The state carries only what a TAP can change,
// so there is no field a pending timeout has to clear - which is the memory
// `lock` trap in session-snapshot-convention.md, avoided by construction rather
// than by a `settle()` at save time. Every transient reaction (the bounce, the
// floating heart) lives in the renderer and never reaches the disk.
//
// TAP, NEVER DRAG. Care is a set of buttons and a tap on the creature itself.
// There is no gesture in this file to make required by accident.
//
// ENDLESS, so this file grants NOTHING. It reports what happened - how much
// care the creature has had, whether it just grew, whether it just crossed a
// milestone - and the renderer decides what that is worth via `winMoment`. The
// earn table lives in `src/sdk/economy.ts` and nowhere else.
//
// PURE: no DOM, no React, no Phaser. The `rng` parameter goes LAST and defaults
// to `Math.random`. Imports are the DIRECT module paths rather than the
// `@shared` barrel, which re-exports React components.
