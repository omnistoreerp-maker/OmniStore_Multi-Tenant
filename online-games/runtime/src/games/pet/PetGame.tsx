/**
 * The renderer. Every rule about what a tap DOES lives in logic.ts; this file
 * decides what a tap LOOKS and SOUNDS like, and what the outcomes it reports
 * are worth to the economy.
 *
 * TAP, NEVER DRAG. There is no drag path here to be the only way through, and
 * `logic.ts` has no gesture in it at all. Four big buttons and the creature
 * itself: a five-year-old on a phone, and anyone on assistive input, cannot
 * reliably hold a sustained pointer gesture.
 *
 * NO READING REQUIRED. The pet asks for things in a thought bubble with a face
 * in it, the matching button wears the same face and a ring, and the four
 * buttons are faces too. The sentence above the pet is there for whoever wants
 * it, with a speaker beside it, and nothing on this screen is unreachable
 * without it - which is the hard rule at the top of `src/sdk/speech.ts`.
 *
 * NO FAILURE. There is no refused tap, no wrong answer, no shake and no fail
 * sound anywhere in this file. The pet cannot get sick, sad or hungry, and it
 * cannot notice that a week went by.
