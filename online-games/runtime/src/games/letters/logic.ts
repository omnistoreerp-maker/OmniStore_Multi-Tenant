//
// PURE: no DOM, no React, no timers. Imports go to the DIRECT shared modules

// nothing here, and it should not - a French article about this game does not
// imply a French alphabet mode inside it. Adding French to SHIPPED_LOCALES
// does, and reds this line by name.
//
// A first letter is NEVER a Hebrew FINAL form (ך ם ן ף ץ), so those are absent -
// a wrong answer must still be a real letter a child recognises, and a final
// form offered mid-word reads as subtly off. Spanish keeps Ñ as its own letter
// and folds accented vowels onto their base (see `firstLetter`), so the pool is
// A-Z plus Ñ and no accented forms.
