// Catch the Bubbles ("תפסו בועות") — PURE logic. No DOM, no React, no Phaser,
// and NO simulation loop: where a bubble IS on screen is the renderer's
// question, answered by the Web Animations API through `@shared/spawn`. This
// file only decides WHAT a bubble carries and WHETHER the round is done.
//
// Modules are imported by DIRECT path, never through the `@shared` barrel — the
// barrel re-exports `Prompt` and `winMoment`, which pull React and the portal
// in, and the purity gate at `src/games/logic-is-pure.test.ts` fails on it.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE LADDER IS BUILT AROUND LOOK-ALIKE CHARACTERS, NOT AROUND SPEED ALONE.
//
// A four-year-old who is still learning that ב and כ are two letters should not
// be asked to tell them apart in order to play. Speed is the easy lever and the
// wrong one to lean on: a slow round full of look-alikes is still a reading
// test. So each level declares a policy over CONFUSION GROUPS —
//
//   easy    AVOID  — no bubble in the round can be mistaken for the target
//   medium  ALLOW  — look-alikes turn up when the draw produces them
//   hard    PREFER — look-alikes are seeded on purpose; the round IS the
//                    discrimination exercise
//
// `logic.test.ts` pins easy at exactly zero look-alikes across 120 rounds per
// locale, with medium as the positive control that proves the zero is real and
// not a broken comparison returning false for everything.
