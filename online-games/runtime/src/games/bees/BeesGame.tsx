// INLINE SVG, NOT EMOJI — and the reason is the whole game.
//
// This round asks a four-year-old to tell two flying things apart in about a
// second, so the difference has to be OURS. 🐝 and 🦋 are drawn by whichever
// emoji font the device ships: on some of them the bee is wings-spread and
// symmetric, which is the butterfly's exact silhouette, and we would never know
// because it looked fine on the machine we tested on.
//
// Each creature therefore carries three cues, none of them hue: SILHOUETTE (one
// wide low blob vs a tall symmetric X with a thin waist), INTERNAL PATTERN (two
// heavy black bars vs two white eye-spots — both survive greyscale, so a
// colour-blind child reads them the same way) and MASS (weight low and forward
// behind a dark head, vs mostly empty wing). Colour is the fourth and least
// load-bearing.
