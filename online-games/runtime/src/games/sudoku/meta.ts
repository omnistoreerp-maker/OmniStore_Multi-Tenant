  // dark ink and 3.87:1 against the light, both under the 4.5:1 floor, so the
  // name strip failed contrast whichever way `inkFor` chose. At #0b6bb5 the
  // light ink reaches 5.55:1. Nothing persists a game's colour, so changing it
  // costs no player anything - see ui/ink.ts and ui/contrast.test.ts.
