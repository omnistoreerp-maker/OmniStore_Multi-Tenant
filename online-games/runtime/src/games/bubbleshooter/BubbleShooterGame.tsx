/**
 * The renderer, and the answer to "which engine".
 *
 * NONE, and that is a measurement rather than a shortcut. This repo ran three
 * engine tournaments (`docs/engine-tournament/`) and the standing verdict is
 * that Phaser stays for what already uses it — snake, the only canvas game —
 * while a new game "almost certainly needs no engine". This one is the case
 * that argues hardest for one and still does not need it:
 *
 *   · what an engine sells is a game loop, a scene graph, input plumbing and a
 *     sprite batcher. The batcher is the one that matters, and it matters at
 *     hundreds of sprites. A full board here is 115 circles, drawn once per
 *     frame by `arc()` — three orders of magnitude under where batching starts
 *     to pay, and Phaser's own 379 KB would be paid by every player of THIS
 *     game to buy it (its chunk is lazy, so it is not shared with anything);
 *   · the loop an engine provides is the fixed-timestep one that
 *     `.claude/rules/fixed-timestep-must-match-display.md` exists about. There
 *     is no simulation stepping here at all — `logic.ts` solves each shot in
 *     one call and this file interpolates along the answer by wall-clock
 *     elapsed time, so a 60, 120 or 144 Hz display draws the same flight at the
 *     same speed and a dropped frame costs nothing;
 *   · Pointer Events are the input layer this platform's rules require anyway.
 *
 * So the whole engine surface reduces to `requestAnimationFrame`, one 2D
 * context, and `performance.now()`. Cost to the player: zero bytes beyond the
 * game's own chunk.
 *
 * WHAT LIVES HERE AND WHAT DOES NOT. Every rule — where a bubble lands, what
 * pops, what falls, what a shot is worth — is in `logic.ts` and is unit-tested
 * in node with no canvas. This file decides only what those answers LOOK and
 * SOUND like.

            WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN THE CONTROL ROW: it costs the layout
            nothing. The bottom corner of the board is dead space - the launcher
            sits centre-bottom and bubbles rest from the ceiling down, so nothing
            is ever drawn under this. Measured at 360x726 on the built page,
            scroll pinned to 0: with the switch on its own row Shoot's bottom sat
            at 721 in a 726 viewport; here it sits at 677.

            THE COLOURS ARE MEASURED, not chosen. This floats on the BOARD, whose
            background is `--surface-2`, so that is the surface every pair here
            is against (2026-09-05, both themes):

              --surface  on --surface-2   1.08 market / 1.14 night   invisible
              --line     on --surface-2   1.18 / 1.06                invisible
              --text-dim on --surface-2   5.85 / 7.00                the edge
              --on-brand on --brand-strong 5.87 / 4.86               the glyph

            So the EDGE carries the shape in both states and the fill only says
            on or off - a fill-only design disappears against the board in one
            theme or the other. `--brand-strong` is flat; the gradient
            `--brand-fill` cannot carry a label at all
            (a-contrast-floor-is-a-floor-not-a-target.md). */}
