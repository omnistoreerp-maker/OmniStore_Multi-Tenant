// Merge - pure game logic for the combine-two-into-the-next-one-up mechanic.
//
// TAP, NEVER DRAG. Every merge game a child has seen is a drag game, and drag
// is exactly what a five-year-old on a phone - and anyone on assistive input -
// cannot reliably hold. So the model here is a SELECTION plus a reducer: tap a
// creature to pick it up, tap another to put it there. A renderer is free to
// add drag on top, but it may never be the only way through (see the kids rule
// in CLAUDE.md). That is why there is no `drag(from, to)` in this file.
//
// ENDLESS, so there is no completion and this file grants NOTHING. It reports
// what happened - a merge, the rung it reached, whether that rung is new this
// run - and the renderer decides what to do with it via `winMoment`. The earn
// table lives in `src/sdk/economy.ts` and nowhere else.
//
// PURE: no DOM, no React, no Phaser. The `rng` parameter goes LAST and defaults
// to `Math.random`. Imports are the DIRECT module paths rather than the
// `@shared` barrel, which re-exports React components.
