 * and a check that cannot see a value reports green about it forever. So the
 * arithmetic lives in the comment and in `logic.ts`, and the result lives here
 * as three literals that `logic.test.ts` reads back.
 *
 * The arithmetic. A board is `size` cells wide PLUS a clue gutter of
 * `maxRuns(size) * 0.5` cells, which is 6.5, 12.5 and 19 cell-widths at the
 * three tiers. The desktop panel leaves 684px, so the px cap is that over the
 * width in cells: 684/6.5 = 105, 684/12.5 = 54, 684/19 = 36. The caps below sit
 * just under each, giving 572, 650 and 646px of board.
 *
 * On a 390px phone the vw term binds instead and a hard cell lands near 18px.
