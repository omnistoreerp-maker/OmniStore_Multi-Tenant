/*
 * THE PC BOARD: the shadow and the pictures SIDE BY SIDE, because a PC window is
 * wide and a column of plate-over-tiles would be bounded by its height long
 * before it used the width. Every length is a share of the board's width (`cqw`),
 * and the tiles stay a balanced block - two by two for four, one column of three
 * for three - so no picture is ever stranded on a line of its own.
 *
 *   four   plate 49, gap 2, tiles 2 x 23.5 with a 2 gap  -> 100 wide, 49 tall
 *   three  plate 49, gap 2, one column of 3 x 15 with 2 gaps -> 66 wide, 49 tall,
 *          centred in the same 100-wide board
 *
 * BOTH LEVELS ARE THE SAME 100 x 49 BOARD. They were 100 x 49 and 99.5 x 74,
 * and on the Game table a laptop window binds the wide one by its WIDTH and
 * the tall one by its HEIGHT, so a difficulty change moved the frame 495 ->
 * 470px (assert:difficulty, 2026-09-29). One box shape means one height
 * whichever bound applies; the three-choice tiles are 15/23.5 of the four's,
 * which is still 112px on a 1536px window.
 *
 * The glyphs keep the phone's proportions to their box: 60/108 of a tile and
 * 190/300 of the plate.
