// moving thing on a clock; this one moves nothing until a child taps, and the
// space itself is the puzzle rather than an empty field. `hidden` and
// `finddiff` are about LOOKING - everything here is visible from the first
// frame and the whole question is which order to collect it in. The header of
// `logic.ts` carries the full comparison.
//
// The mouse, the crumbs and the burrow are ours, and generic: a maze is as old
// as mazes, and nothing here quotes anybody's characters or colours.
