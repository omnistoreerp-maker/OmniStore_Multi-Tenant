 * white is the same shape in white ink with a dark outline. The outline set
 * (U+2654..2659) is NOT used, because it is hairline at a phone's cell size
 * and several fonts substitute a different face for it, so the two armies stop
 * matching. This is what the approved mock draws.
 *
 * THE PAWN CARRIES U+FE0E, and it is the only one that needs it. U+265F is
 * the one glyph in the set that Unicode also lists as an EMOJI (the other
 * five are not), so an iPhone draws it from the colour-emoji font - a black
 * pawn picture that ignores `color` and `-webkit-text-stroke` alike. Reported
 * from an iPhone on 2026-09-21, Hebrew, at the opening position: "all the
 * soldiers are black" - soldiers being what Hebrew calls pawns. The text
 * variation selector asks for the text glyph, which does take the army's ink.
 * `a-pawn-is-an-emoji-on-an-iphone.test.ts` holds it for every glyph, so a
 * future set cannot bring the trap back.

/**
 * THE TWO SIDES ARE A FIXED PAIR, AND NEITHER MAY BE A THEME TOKEN.

 * This shipped as `#fff` against `var(--text)`, which is right on the day

 * 2026-09-21, white-against-black was **16.75:1 in market and 1.08:1 in
 * night**. Both armies rendered the same near-white, and a player could not
 * tell their pieces from the computer's. Found by loading the page, not by
 * any gate here - `contrast.test.ts` reads a hand-kept list of token pairs
 * and this collision is between a token and a literal.
 *
 * A fixed pair alone is not enough either, because the SQUARES invert with
 * the theme - measured the same minute, off the rendered buttons:
 *
 *            squares                 INK alone, against those squares
 *   market   255,247,224 / 234,175,195    light piece 1.00 / 1.72   <- gone
 *   night     57, 54, 70 /  57, 54,121    dark  piece 1.45 / 1.61   <- gone
 *
 * So each side carries the OTHER tone as an outline, `paintOrder: stroke
 * fill` so the outline sits outside the glyph rather than eating it. The
 * light army reads by its dark edge on a light board and by its fill on a
 * dark one; the dark army does the opposite. Sides against each other:
 * 15.96:1 in BOTH themes, which is the number that actually matters.

 * at night both were navy (57,54,70 and 57,54,121), so the dark army was
