// `scoreUnit: "ms"` is a DECLARATION the boards screen depends on, not a label.
// Only the number of a record is persisted, so nothing reading
// `ellaz:onestroke:score:hard` back off the disk can tell 41,200 milliseconds
// from 41,200 points, and the two rank opposite ways round. It must agree with
// what the renderer reports; `score-unit-declared.test.ts` reads both sources
// and requires it.
//
// A clock and not a tap count, and that is forced rather than chosen: every
// line that finishes a board is exactly one square long per open square, so a
// tap count is the same number for every winner on a level and ranks nobody.
