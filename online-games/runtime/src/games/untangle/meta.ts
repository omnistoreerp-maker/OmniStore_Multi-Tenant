// `scoreUnit: "ms"` is a DECLARATION the boards screen depends on, not a label.
// Only the number of a record is persisted, so nothing reading
// `ellaz:untangle:score:hard` back off the disk can tell 42,500 milliseconds
// from 42,500 points, and the two rank opposite ways round. It must agree with
// the `unit:` this game reports; `score-unit-declared.test.ts` reads both
// sources and requires it.
//
// The clock is the record here rather than a move count for a reason written
// out at `scoreFor` in `logic.ts`: putting a dot down is free, so a move count
// would put a price on exploring, which is the one thing this platform does not
// do to a child.

  // fix; there is no ink that rescues a 4.38.
