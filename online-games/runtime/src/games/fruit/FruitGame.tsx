        NO `dir="ltr"` here, and that is a decision rather than an omission.
        The rule pins a grid LTR when its POSITION or its INPUT is directional -
        n2048's grid mirrors and its swipes then invert. Nothing here is
        logical: every fruit is placed with a PHYSICAL `left`, and the pointer
        is read out of `getBoundingClientRect`, which is physical too. The box
        renders identically in Hebrew and English because neither of those two
        properties has ever heard of a writing direction.

        It is a <button> because it IS one - the whole box is a drop target. A
        div with a pointer handler would be unreachable by keyboard, and this
        game must be playable without a pointing device at all.
