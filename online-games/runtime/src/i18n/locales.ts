/**
 * Which languages exist, and in what capacity. Two lists, and the difference
 * between them is the whole point.
 *
 * A leaf module: it imports NOTHING, which is what lets the app, the build-time
 * page emitter and `src/content` all read the same answer. Two lists that
 * disagree about which languages have pages is the failure this file exists to
 * make impossible.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THERE ARE TWO
 *
 * Google's own documentation, verbatim:
 *
 *   "Localized versions of a page are only considered duplicates if the main
 *    content of the page remains untranslated."
 *
 * and, under things to avoid:
 *
 *   "Translating only the boilerplate text of your pages while keeping the bulk
 *    of your content in a single language."
 *
 * So a language that has our BUTTONS but not our ARTICLES must emit no
 * document at all. Emitting `/de/games/snake/` with a German header and an
 * English body is not a smaller version of a German page - it is the named
 * anti-pattern, once per game, on a site that currently has none of it.
 *
 * `APP_LOCALES` is what the interface speaks. `PAGE_LOCALES` is what has prose.
 * `ROUTES` is derived from PAGE_LOCALES, so adding a language to the app emits
 * exactly zero documents and cannot cost us anything.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW A LANGUAGE GETS PROMOTED
 *
 * `GameContent.copy` is `Record<PageLocale, GameCopy>` and `SITE` is
 * `Record<PageLocale, SiteCopy>`. So adding a locale to PAGE_LOCALES before its
 * prose exists is a RED BUILD in all 22 content files plus site.ts - not a
 * lint warning, not a convention someone can forget, and not a script that can
 * be wrong about what it scanned. The compiler refuses.
 *
 * That is deliberate: every other guard in this repo is a script reading
 * `dist/`, and the lesson of 2026-08-08 is that a script can be confidently
 * wrong about what it is looking at. A type cannot.
 *
 * Promotion is therefore always two commits, in this order:
 *   1. write `<locale>` prose into all 22 content files and site.ts
 *   2. add `"<locale>"` here
 * Doing them the other way round fails the build, which is the gate working.
 */

/**
 * Every language the interface speaks.
 *
 * Order is display order in the picker: English first because it is the
 * default the site answers in, Hebrew second because it is ours, then the rest
 * by rough audience size. Adding one here costs the translation of ~341
 * strings and NOTHING else - no route, no page, no sitemap entry, no share
 * card.

/**
 * The languages whose AUTHORED APP STRINGS ship in the bundle.
 *
 * A third list, and it exists because the other two answer different questions
 * and this one decides what a child DOWNLOADS.
 *
 *   APP_LOCALES     what the interface speaks          (chrome, lazy per language)
 *   PAGE_LOCALES    what has written prose             (build-time, emitted, never shipped)
 *   SHIPPED_LOCALES what authored app text exists in   (game titles, animal names, shop items)
 *
 * It used to BE `PageLocale` - `type Locale = PageLocale` in `strings.ts` - and
 * that alias is what made adding a page language cost the first visit. A game
 * title is `Record<Locale, string>` on the DOM-free meta, and the roster imports
 * all 29 metas STATICALLY, so every page language dragged 29 more titles into
 * the shell chunk. Measured before the split: promoting the eight remaining app
 * languages added 3,351 B gz of titles alone and 9,120 B gz across every shell
 * record, against 625 B of headroom. A 14x overrun, to ship eleven names of one
 * game to a child who reads one language.
 *
 * Separated, a new page language costs the bundle EXACTLY ZERO. Pages read
 * their game name from `GameCopy.name` in `src/content` instead, which is
 * build-time only and never shipped.
 *
 * It is a subset of APP_LOCALES and deliberately NOT tied to PAGE_LOCALES in
 * either direction: prose and shipped strings are different work, done by
 * different people, at different costs. Widening this list is a PAYLOAD
 * decision - run `npm run assert:payload` before and after - while widening
 * PAGE_LOCALES is a prose decision that the payload gate will not even notice.
 *
 * Anything read through `textFor()` falls back to English, so an app language
 * outside this list renders English game names rather than blanks. That is the
 * same answer `x-default` gives a crawler.
 *
 * AND SINCE 2026-09-22 IT IS NOT A SUBSET OF PAGE_LOCALES. It happened to be one
 * for as long as both lists read en/he/es, and code was written against the
 * coincidence: `ogGlyphs.test.ts` indexed `SITE` - which is `Record<PageLocale,
 * SiteCopy>` - by a SHIPPED locale, and compiled for a year. Swedish ships app
 * strings and has no prose, so that line is now a type error and the test loops
 * PAGE_LOCALES, which is what it always meant. If you are about to index
 * anything page-shaped by a shipped locale, that is the same bug.
