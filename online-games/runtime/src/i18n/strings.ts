// Ellaz UI strings — the portal-shell chrome, in every language the app speaks.
//
// The strings themselves live one-language-per-file in `dict/`. This file is
// the resolver, and it keeps the API it has always had (`makeT`, `STRINGS`,
// `DIR`, `LOCALES`) so nothing that renders had to change when the shape did.
//
// WHY ONE FILE PER LANGUAGE
// The old shape was `key -> { he, en }`, which reads beautifully and cannot be
// code-split: every language is interleaved with every other, so a bundler has
// to ship all of them or none. Twelve interleaved dictionaries in the shell
// would land on a child's first visit, and the first visit has ~3 KB of room.
// Keyed by LANGUAGE first, each one is a module Rollup can put in its own
// chunk.
//
// `he` and `en` are STATIC. They are the two the shell has always carried, so
// the split costs the first visit nothing, and English — the default since
// 2026-08-14 — must render on the first frame with nothing to await. Hebrew
// stays static beside it: it is the other language with pages, and it was the
// default long enough that most returning players still have it stored. Every
// other language is a
// `locale-<xx>` chunk fetched only by somebody who asked for it, PAGE
// LANGUAGES INCLUDED: see the note on `STATIC_LOCALES` for why that stopped
// being "make it static" and became "make the page fetch it".
//
// Until that chunk arrives, a string resolves through ENGLISH rather than
// through Hebrew: English is the x-default and the root for exactly this
// reason. A Turkish visitor seeing English for 200ms is reading a language
// they may know; seeing Hebrew is reading an alphabet they do not.

/**
 * `Locale` STAYS `"he" | "en"`, and that is a decision worth reading twice.
 *
 * It is the type of AUTHORED TEXT — a game's title, a difficulty label, the
 * name of an animal a game reads aloud. Widening it to all twelve app languages
 * was tried first and the compiler answered with 200+ errors demanding a
 * Spanish name for every balloon, which is the right answer to the wrong
 * question: those strings are written by a person, exactly like page prose, and
 * `PageLocale` is the type that already means "somebody wrote this".
 *
 * It would also have been a payload disaster. `meta.ts` is imported STATICALLY
 * by the roster so the home grid can render without pulling in game code, so
 * eleven titles per game is 23 x 9 extra strings in the SHELL — against 3 KB of
 * headroom.
 *
 * So there are THREE types and they mean different things:
 *   `AppLocale`     — the language the INTERFACE is speaking (11). `t()`, `DIR`.
 *   `Locale`        — the language a HUMAN WROTE this SHIPPED string in (3).
 *   `PageLocale`    — the language a page's PROSE is written in (3, and growing).
 *
 * `Locale` was an alias for `PageLocale` until 2026-08-16, and that alias was
 * the thing standing between this site and pages in every language it speaks:
 * a page language could not be added without dragging 29 more game titles into
 * the shell. Measured, it was 3,351 B gz for titles and 9,120 B gz across every
 * shell record to reach eleven — against 625 B of headroom.
 *
 * They are the same three languages TODAY and they are no longer the same
 * QUESTION. A page needs its game name from `GameCopy.name` in `src/content`
 * (build-time, never shipped); the app needs it from `meta.title` (shipped).
 * Growing the first is free; growing the second is a payload decision.
 *
 * A component that renders a title in the app's language resolves through
 * `textFor()` below, which falls back to English rather than pretending.

 * resolves out of `STATIC` or falls back to English and stays there — Spanish
 * prose wrapped in English buttons, permanently, nothing thrown.
 *
 * The obvious repair is to make every page locale static. It works, and it bills
 * every child on earth for it: Spanish alone measured **+1,363 B gz** on the
 * first visit against 1,657 B of headroom, and a Hebrew-speaking four-year-old
 * in Tel Aviv would download the Spanish dictionary to reach a game that has no
 * Spanish in it. The next page language would do the same again.
 *
 * So `bootContentPage` AWAITS its locale's dictionary instead, and it does so
 * while the poster is still up — a page has not mounted anything yet, so there
 * is no flash to trade for the bytes. `page-loads-its-dictionary.test.ts` pins
 * that await; without it this is exactly the silent-English-buttons bug again.
