// Sharing - turning ONE GAME into an invite a parent can send, and nothing else.
//
// Fourth sibling of economy.ts, score.ts and session.ts, and the same shape: a
// screen reports WHAT IT IS and this module alone decides what may leave the
// device. A caller cannot hand it a score, a streak, a lifetime total or a
// history, because there is no field for one - `GameInvite` holds a game id, a
// title and a glyph. The absence of those fields is the feature, exactly as
// `daily.ts` has no `brokenAt`.
//
// It used to be a DAILY DIGEST, keyed on a `ShareDay`, sent from the home
// screen. Operator ruling 2026-08-25 retired both halves: "the share card in
// homepage shouldmove from here. we should add per game share options instead",
// and, asked what a per-game share should carry, "An invite - just the game."
// `buildShare`, `ShareDay`, `DayPlay` and `shareDay.ts` were DELETED in the same
// change rather than left beside this - two payload builders, one wired and one
// not, is `.claude/rules/... no-half-migrated-duplicate-systems`.
//
// THE ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT
// A share payload is seen by strangers. This device's backup code restores the
// whole profile - coins, stars, room, records - onto any device that has it
// (`cloud.ts` § restore), and every `ellaz:` key is a name for progress sitting
// on the disk. NEITHER MAY EVER TRAVEL. Two things enforce that and they are
// deliberately different in kind:
//
//   1. STRUCTURAL. The payload is CONSTRUCTED field by field from an allow-list
//      below. Nothing here spreads, serialises or iterates a piece of app state,
//      so there is no path by which a field added elsewhere arrives here.
//   2. MECHANICAL. Every string that reaches the payload passes `scrub()`, and
//      `buildGameInvite` asserts the finished payload afterwards. A title that
//      contains a code or a storage key is REDACTED rather than refused, so the
//      failure mode is a share with a dot in it rather than a child who cannot
//      share at all.
//
// The structural half is the one that actually holds. The mechanical half is
// there because "nothing can reach here" is a claim about code somebody will
// change, and `share.test.ts` plants both leaks to prove the claim is checkable.
//
// PURE. No DOM, no storage, no clock at all - which is the shape the day payload
// could never have. The picture lives in `portal/shareCard.ts`, the rasteriser
// in `portal/shareCardRender.ts`, and the sheet in `portal/ShareSheet.tsx`.

/**
 * A backup code, as `backupCode.ts` writes one: eight Crockford base32

 *

 * `vite.config.ts`, so importing it would drag the whole backup client behind
 * this module. `share.test.ts` pins the pattern against real output from
 * `makeBackupCode`, so the two cannot drift apart in silence.
 *
 * NO `\b` ANCHORS, and that is a fix rather than sloppiness. A word boundary
 * requires a non-word character before the code, so `snakeABCD-EFGH` — a code
 * glued straight onto a title — has no boundary at the `eA` seam and slips
 * through a `\b`-anchored pattern entirely. The bisect test below caught that
 * on the first run with the anchors in place.
 *
 * Case-insensitive, and unanchored means it can also fire on an innocent
 * hyphenated title of the right shape (`Race-2048` matches; `Word-Play` does
 * not, because the excluded letters I/L/O/U rule out most English). That
 * over-match is the correct direction for a REFUSAL guarding a child's whole
 * profile: a false positive puts a `•••` in one shared message, a false
 * negative hands a stranger the room. The control in `share.test.ts` runs every
 * real catalog title through it, so a title that starts tripping this shows up
 * as a red build rather than as a puzzled parent.
