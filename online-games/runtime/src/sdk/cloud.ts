// Cloud backup — anonymous identity and one document, over plain HTTP.
//
// WHY NO FIREBASE SDK
// `firebase/app` + `firebase/auth` + `firebase/firestore` is roughly 150-200 KB
// gz even tree-shaken — nearly three times this app's ENTIRE first visit, which
// the last two waves spent halving. What this platform needs from it is: sign in
// anonymously, read one document, write one document. All three are ordinary
// REST calls, so they are ~200 lines of our own code and zero dependencies. The
// SDK's real value is offline persistence and realtime listeners, and we need
// neither: localStorage is already the offline store, and a leaderboard that
// updates on open is the correct product anyway.
//
// WHY A WRITTEN-DOWN CODE
// Anonymous identity lives in the browser's own storage, so "clear browsing
// data" destroys the key to the cloud copy at the same moment it destroys the
// local one. Nothing inside the device survives that. The code is the one thing
// that can, and the app says so plainly rather than implying magic.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT
// It is a BACKUP and a TRANSFER, not live two-way sync. Restoring onto a device
// copies the saved progress across; from then on the two devices drift apart
// again, because merging two independently-earned coin balances needs per-device
// counters the profile does not yet carry. Claiming otherwise would be the kind
// of quiet data loss the wallet's rollback discipline exists to prevent.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS FAIL-SOFT. No network, a blocked request, an exhausted free
// quota, a hostile proxy: every one of them resolves to `null` or `false`. This
// module must never throw into gameplay, and nothing a child can do depends on
// it succeeding.

     * One collection-group query across every `boards/<id>/scores/<id>` document —
     * no filter, no order, so it needs no composite index (a plain group scan
     * is covered by Firestore's automatic per-collection indexing). Ranking,
     * windowing and pooling all happen client-side, in `pooled.ts`, which is
     * pure and therefore testable without a network.
     *
     * `firestore.rules` had to widen its match from `boards/{board}/scores/{uid}`
     * to `{path=**}/scores/{uid}` for this to be legal at all — a rule scoped to
     * one board never authorises a query across all of them, whatever it says
     * about read access at any single path. See the rules file for the "the
     * write clause never used `board`, so nothing about who may write changed"
     * argument that made the widening safe.
     *
     * Requesting one more than the limit is how a full page is told apart from
     * an exactly-full corpus — asking for exactly `POOLED_LIMIT` can never
     * distinguish "there were precisely this many" from "there were more".
