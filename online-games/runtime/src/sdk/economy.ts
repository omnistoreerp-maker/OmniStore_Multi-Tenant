 * quietly deletes the only reason coins exist. So the daily puzzle pays NOTHING

 * permanent high-water mark). A child playing every day for a year is paid

 * rarer without anyone having to price rarity twice. Splitting "how often" from
 * "how much" is the same split as the one between this file and `score.ts` —

/**
 * What a finished PASS-AND-PLAY match pays. One flat coin, no tier, no star.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS NUMBER SOLVES. Two people on one device share ONE profile
 * and ONE wallet, so "pay the winner" is not a thing this app can express — the
 * coins land in the same purse either way. And nothing can tell two children
 * apart from one child tapping both sides, because there IS nothing to tell
 * them apart WITH: no accounts, no logins, no second device. So a two-player
 * mode that pays like a solo win is a coin printer with a friendly face, and no
 * amount of detection would fix it. The payout has to be safe by ARITHMETIC.
 *
 * So it is: a match pays strictly LESS than the weakest solo win there is
 * (`TIER_COINS.easy`, 3). A child who wants coins is better off playing alone —
 * five taps of solo tictactoe on easy pay 3, the same five taps tapping both
 * sides of a versus match pay 1. Farming this mode is a way to earn a THIRD of
 * what the child could already earn, which is the only kind of "cannot be
 * farmed" that survives having no way to identify anybody.
 * `versus.test.ts` pins that ordering, and it goes red if the reason is ever
 * routed through the tier table.
 *
 * WHY IT IS PER MATCH AND NOT PER WIN. Because a loss must not be a punishment
 * — that is the whole platform. The coin is for FINISHING something together,
 * so it lands whoever won, and the child who lost sees it land too. It is also
 * why there is no tier: a "hard" match is not harder for the wallet.
 *
 * WHY NO STAR. Stars are never spent and never lost, they drive the profile's
 * win count, and `requiresStars` turns them into ACCESS to the premium shelf.
 * A star is the trophy for something the profile's owner did; beating a sibling
 * at snap is a fact about two people, one of whom is not the profile. Minting
 * one here would farm the one currency the coin cap does not bound.
