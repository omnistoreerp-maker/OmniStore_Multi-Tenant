// Every board at once — PURE, zero I/O, and the half of the standings screen
// that can be checked without a network.
//
// WHY ONE READ AND NOT ONE READ PER BOARD
// `cloud.board()` answers "where am I on THIS board" in four requests, and it
// scales: the counts are aggregations, so a board with ten thousand players
// costs the same as one with ten. That is the right shape for one board and the
// wrong shape for the question this screen asks, which is about all of them at
// once — the test reader holds 19 boards, so a per-board design is 57 requests
// before the screen can draw a single row.
//
// So the screen makes ONE collection-group read of every score row and does the
// ranking here. Every row already carries its value in all four windows, so the
// window pills cost nothing after the first read, and the medals screen and the
// standings screen are two views of the same fetch.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS, STATED PLAINLY, BECAUSE IT IS THE THING THAT WILL BREAK
// It is O(every score row on the platform), and Firestore bills per document
// read. Measured 2026-08-24 the whole corpus is 128 rows across 34 live boards,
// so a screen open is 128 reads against a 50,000/day free allowance. That is
// comfortable now and it is NOT a design that grows: at a few thousand rows the
// daily allowance buys a handful of opens, and the answer then is a server-side
// rollup, not a bigger limit. `POOLED_LIMIT` is the tripwire rather than the
// solution — when a read comes back full, `pooledTables` says so through
// `truncated` and the screen stops claiming to rank everybody.
//
// This is the exact failure cloud.ts warns about — "the version that stops
// working exactly when the platform starts succeeding" — chosen deliberately,
// with the number that says when, rather than stumbled into.
