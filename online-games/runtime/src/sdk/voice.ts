// a browser, the same split every game uses for its logic.ts.
//
// THE NINE VOICES BELOW WERE ALL PICKED ON 2026-08-13, in the sound lab, with
// the names showing. Six of them replaced a winner of the blind tournament held
// on 2026-08-02 (45 synthesised characters across 6 events, the incumbent
// included unlabelled in every one). Both facts are true and they sound like
// they contradict each other, so keep them straight: a blind round asks which
// sounds better with nothing else to go on, a named pick asks which one belongs
// in this app, and the second question is the one that ships.
//
// `src/lab/voices.ts` records which is which (`VERDICT`, `OVERRODE_BLIND`) and
// `src/lab/previous.ts` holds every superseded spec verbatim. Nothing was lost,
// so nothing needs reconstructing from memory - which is the whole lesson of
// the earlier verdict recorded as "the control won" without saying what the
// control was. See docs/juice-map.md and docs/juice-lab.md.
//
// WHAT MAKES THESE SOUND DESIGNED RATHER THAN SYNTHESISED, in order of how much
// it matters - and only one of the four is the note:
//
//   1. HIGH PARTIALS DECAY FASTER THAN THE FUNDAMENTAL. Strike anything real and
//      its bright modes die first; that is why a struck object sounds struck.
//      One shared envelope across every partial produces an organ tone and the
//      ear hears "synthesiser" instantly. `struck()` damps each partial by
//      ratio^damp. This is the big one - the first palette was rejected without
//      it and accepted with it, on the same notes.
//   2. IT HAPPENS SOMEWHERE. A dry note has no room, and no room reads as cheap
//      however good the pitch is. Every voice carries a little `space`.
//   3. INHARMONICITY. A bell is not 1:2:3. Real partial ratios are what make
//      metal sound like metal rather than like a stack of sines.
//   4. RESTRAINT. Short, quiet, no top-end glare. "Bright" and "expensive" are
//      opposites above about 9kHz, which is what `warmth` exists for.

/**
 * streak - one rung of the ladder, and the ladder is NOT in here.
 *
 * This is a single warm tine note. `src/sdk/streak.ts` alone decides which
 * SEMITONE it plays at for a given run of correct answers, exactly the way
 * `economy.ts` decides what a reason is worth and `score.ts` decides which
 * direction a unit ranks. A game reports how many in a row; it never picks a
 * pitch, so thirty games cannot invent thirty different ladders.
 *
 * It transposes rather than re-synthesising, which is not an optimisation - it
 * is what keeps the level-match trim valid. A fresh spec per rung would mint a
 * new object every note, miss the trim cache, and play the ladder unmatched
 * against the palette it is supposed to sit inside.
 *
 * "Glass", picked 2026-08-13 over four alternatives INCLUDING at the top rung,
 * which is the only way this one can honestly be chosen. It is the single voice
 * in the app heard transposed - up 21 semitones, a seventh above two octaves -
 * and the lab's streak row exists so a timbre that is lovely at C5 and shrill
 * at A6 gets caught before it ships rather than after. The strip called this
 * arm "the riskiest high up" and it won there anyway.
 *
 * Its top partial reaches 14.8 kHz at the cap, comfortably representable, so
 * unlike `star` this one needs nothing from the Nyquist guard.
