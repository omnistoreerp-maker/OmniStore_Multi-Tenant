// on the platform reads and writes this same record through the wallet, so the
// schema is deliberately small and boring.
//
// Storage access goes through an injectable KeyValueBackend rather than
// touching localStorage directly. That keeps the wallet's logic testable in the
// node vitest environment (where there is no localStorage at all) and mirrors
// the try/catch discipline in storage.ts — a player in incognito, or with
// storage disabled, must still be able to play.
