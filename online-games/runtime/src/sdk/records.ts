// Personal bests, as the thing that TRAVELS between a player's devices.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// A player's progress lives in two unrelated places. The profile — coins,
// stars, the room — is one localStorage key, `ellaz:profile:v1`, and cloud
// backup carries it. Every personal best lives somewhere else entirely, at
// `ellaz:<gameId>:score:<board>`, written by each game's own SaveStore.
//
// So the backup shipped saying "this code brings it back" and brought back the
// coins, the stars and the room while silently dropping every record the child
// had set. Nobody would see an error; they would see a fresh save file with
// their room in it. This module is the missing half.
//
// WHY ONLY RECORDS, AND NOT EVERYTHING A GAME SAVED
// `ctx.storage` lets a game persist anything under its own namespace, and some
// of it is large — a coloring drawing is a data URL. Records are small, bounded,
// and the thing a player would actually mourn. Sweeping every key would put an
// unbounded blob into a document with a 1 MiB ceiling, so the line is drawn at
// `:score:` and drawn deliberately.
//
// WHY THE KEY SHAPE IS CHECKED ON THE WAY IN
// An incoming record set arrived over the network from a document identified by
// a code a stranger could in principle type. If it could name its own storage
// keys it could write `ellaz:cloud:v1` — this device's anonymous IDENTITY — or
// `ellaz:profile:v1`, the balance. `isRecordKey` is what stops that, and it is
// the reason adoption validates keys rather than trusting the sender.
