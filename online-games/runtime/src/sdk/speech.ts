/**
 * Hebrew (and English) text-to-speech for kids who cannot read yet.
 *
 * Uses the browser's built-in Web Speech API — no assets, no network request,
 * nothing to precache. Voices ship with the operating system.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * HARD RULE — SPEECH IS ALWAYS SUPPLEMENTARY, NEVER THE QUESTION ITSELF.
 *
 * A voice can be present in `getVoices()`, be selected, fire `onend` on time,
 * and still emit NO SOUND (some Android WebViews, some locked-down kiosks).
 * That failure is undetectable from JavaScript — there is no signal to check.
 *
 * So every game MUST work with the sound off. A letter game SHOWS the letter and
 * offers a speaker button that says it; it never asks "tap what you hear" unless
 * `available(locale)` is true, and even then the visible affordance stays. If
 * removing speech would make the game unplayable, the design is wrong.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Five more real-world traps this module absorbs so games don't have to:
 *
 * 1. `getVoices()` returns `[]` until the `voiceschanged` event fires — always on
 *    Chrome, sometimes on Safari. A game that reads `available()` once at mount
 *    concludes "no Hebrew" on a machine that has it. Hence `onAvailabilityChange`,
 *    which is mandatory, not optional.
 * 2. iOS refuses the first `speak()` outside a user gesture → `unlock()` speaks a
 *    silent utterance, exactly like `audioPort.unlock()`.
 * 3. Speech respects `audioPort.muted`. The header mute button is the only sound
 *    control a parent will find; speech that ignored it would make the app
 *    un-mutable.
 * 4. Chrome goes silent after ~15s of continuous synthesis and pauses on tab
 *    hide, and can then never fire `onend` → we cancel before each speak, keep
 *    utterances short (single letters/words is the whole use case), and arm a
 *    watchdog so an awaited `speak()` can never hang a game loop forever.
 * 5. Nothing here throws or rejects. Ever. Speech failing must not be a bug
 *    report — it must be silence.
